      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this site is to

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>In the audience are families, primarily fathers who plan to take their

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      I chose this font becuase I beleive 
      it speaks to a large demographic and is easy to read.

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Yusei Magic
      
      </h4>
      <p>
        [Reasoning]
        It's artsy to catch the eye but not in the paragraphs to be too distracting
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: 
        PT 
        Sans
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font is easy to read and not too busy,but also a little different than what you'd see
        on a default browser font or website.
      
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
        offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
        Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
        Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
        physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
        adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
        happen for you.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it soundsâ€¦it is a map of the pages
        in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
        above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
        child pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
        be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
        global navigation for the site.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6 sections to our page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain
          means an image) and the navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>
          Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
          icons.
        </li>
      </ol>
