            We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing.
            That is why we subscribe to the raft adventures philosophy of
            boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look
            around and notice the beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.

            We run whitewater for the rush
          </h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-2">
            That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things
            after all. We believe that that tenseness that comes when you are
            looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you
            appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.
