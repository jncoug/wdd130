      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My website idea is to create a news/info page dedicated to pickleball. There, avid pickleball fans would gather to get all of the web info they need.
This website would have a home page with a summary of what the sport is, how to get involved, being concise and informative. You would also find useful info about pickleball products, and links to other useful sites, like for detailed tournament schedules, rankings, or equipment stores.
This will be a one stop shop for all things pickleball, something that currently can’t be achieved without searching out and visiting many different websites.
Why are pickleball sites not very engaging? Because their content is mostly singular. What if a website had everything you might think to search for? That would be the place to go, wouldn’t it?
That’s why I think an all in one pickleball news, information, and directory (if you will) site is a great idea to generate a lot of traffic.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience of this page will be of all ages. Grandmas and Grandpas looking to stay active,
      college students learning about a new activity that they can easily to with their friends, and 
        everybody in between. These people need a quick, easy, and SIMPLE guide to the sport,
        before they lose interest or think that it is too complicated to learn and enjoy. Any mom, dad, parent, grandparent or child
        will be able to understand what pickleball is and be excited to start playing.</p>
