            What is Pickleball?
          </h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-2">
            Pickleball is a racket sport similar to tennis, but played on a smaller court and with a plastic ball,
             along with generally graphite/composite paddles. The close proximities and plastic ball allow for fun exchanges 
             between teams and quick hands battles, not unlike the feeling of a ping pong rally. 
            It's one of the fastest growing sports in the United States, both recreationally and competitively.

              Why Should I Play?
            </h2>
            <p class="home-paragraph-3">
                First of all, it's fun! Pickleball is growing so quickly not just because of its accessibility, but its addictiveness. 
                I'm sure if you've come to this site it's because you already play or you're interested in playing. But, if for some reason you think pickleball
                 just isn't for you, let me try to change your mind: You should try pickleball if: <br>

                  1. You don't usually play sports. Even if you are a complete beginner in athletics,
                   pickleball is the best way to get started.It is so easy to hold rallies and complete a game. 
                   Even if all four players have limited athletic experience, instant fun is around the corner. <br>
                  2. You are competitive and want to improve at what you do. Pickleball is an amazing
                   sport to study and improve in. Though beginner-friendly, it takes a lot of time and practice to
                    improve and excel at higher level play. The court size and rules make the game a lot like chess,
                     needing to understand angles, to think ahead, and to be very precise. <br>
                  3. You are a tennis player. If you have a strong tennis background, you can very quickly excel at pickleball.
                   But, be wary, experienced players even with no racket sports background may have to humble you for a while before
                    you understand the intricacies of high-level play. But will find a lot of fun in the learning curve and understanding
                     how the game can be played very beautifully and excitingly <br>
                
                
                If none of these applied to you, you should still give it a go, you might be surprised! So, let's get started!
