            What You Need
          </h2>
          <p class="home-paragraph-2">
            Pickleball is very easy, but you do need some basic things, mostly the right equipment and a place to play. <br>
            1. First, you need the right equipment. If you have a friend who can play with you and lend you
             a paddle and some balls, thats the easiest and cheapest way. Whatever the case, you will need a paddle, and a pickleball.
              There is a difference between outdoor and indoor balls, but the paddle can be any that you prefer. <br>
            2. Next, you need a court! There are many local parks and schools that are building pickleball courts with permanent nets, and 
            you can find somehere.Another option is to tape the lines down yourself with some masking tape on a gym floor or tennis court, 
            and bring a portable net if need be.Hereyou can find the dimensions to follow if that's what you're going to do.

              Play!
            </h2>
            <p class="home-paragraph-3">
                Now that you have the equipment and the court, you can play! The most common way to play is doubles, 
                which means two players on each side of the court. Singles is played the same, but with only one person on the court. 
                For a concise but adequate explanation of play, watch this video. Here some of the key rules of play: <br>
            1. The serve starts with the player on the right side of the court, he serves underhand, diagonally into the opposite court.
             The serve must bounce outside of the kitchen. Then the returner may return the ball anywhere back onto the other side of the court.
              The serving team must let the return bounce, then play continues until the rally is over. <br>
            2. If the serving team wins a rally, they score a point and switch sides. The server then serves again from their new side.
             If the return team wins the rally, there is no point won, but the serve goes to the other player on the team. 
             After both players have had a chance to serve and the return team wins the rally, the player on the right for the other team will begin to serve <br>
            3. The non-volley-zone or "kitchen" is the most important part of the court. You cannot hit the ball out of the air or
             "volley" the ball before it bounces if you are standing in or touching the kitchen. In other words,
              stay out of the kitchen or you wont be able to hit the ball out of the air. <br>
            That's about it! There are many other rules, but you will learn them as you go, focus on having fun! The full rulebook can be found here.
