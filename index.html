        <p>This is for the <strong>first</strong> assignment in class. I'm <em>excited</em> 
            to do more and more web development as the semester goes on. In my free time
            I'll be doing these things though:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>playing pickleball</li>
            <li>being with my wife and little baby</li>
            <li>watching soccer</li>
            <li>eating pizza</li>
        </ul>
